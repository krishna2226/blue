                    <li>Draw your tailbone into the mat to deepen the stretch. You should feel the stretch in your back as the weight and balance shifts to your core. Your chest and shoulders should feel open</li>

                    <li>Next, move into Cat Pose: As you exhale, draw your belly to your spine and round your back toward the ceiling. The pose should look like a cat stretching its back.</li>

                    <li>Spread your knees as wide as your mat, keeping the tops of your feet on the floor with the big toes touching.</li>
                    <li>Rest your belly between your thighs and root your forehead to the floor. Relax the shoulders, jaw, and eyes. If it is not comfortable to place the forehead on the floor, rest it on a block or two stacked fists. There is an energy point at the center of the forehead in between the eyebrows that stimulates the vagus nerve and supports a "rest and digest" response. Finding a comfortable place for the forehead is key to gaining this soothing benefit.</li> 
                    <li>Stretch your arms in front of you with the palms toward the floor or bring your arms back alongside your thighs with the palms facing upwards. You can also stretch the arms forward with palms facing up for a shoulder release or try bending the elbows so that the palms touch and rest the thumbs at the back of the neck. In this position inch the elbows forward.</li>
                    <li>Stay as long as you like, eventually reconnecting with the steady inhales and exhales of your breath.</li>
